## Basic SQL Operations

### 1. What is SQL? Types of SQL Commands? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **SQL:** Structured Query Language for managing databases
- **DDL:** CREATE, ALTER, DROP (Data Definition)
- **DML:** INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (Data Manipulation)
- **DQL:** SELECT (Data Query)
- **DCL:** GRANT, REVOKE (Data Control)

### 2. Primary Key vs Foreign Key? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Primary Key:** Unique identifier, cannot be NULL
- **Foreign Key:** References primary key of another table
- **Primary Key:** One per table, ensures entity integrity
- **Foreign Key:** Multiple allowed, ensures referential integrity

### 3. SELECT Statement Syntax? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT number;
```

### 4. WHERE vs HAVING Clause? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **WHERE:** Filters rows before grouping
- **HAVING:** Filters groups after GROUP BY
- **WHERE:** Cannot use aggregate functions
- **HAVING:** Can use aggregate functions

```sql
-- WHERE example
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

-- HAVING example
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;
```

### 5. DISTINCT Keyword? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Remove duplicate values
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;

-- Count unique values
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) FROM employees;
```

### 6. ORDER BY Clause? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Single column
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Multiple columns
SELECT * FROM employees 
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;

-- Using column position
SELECT name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### 7. LIMIT vs TOP? ‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- MySQL/PostgreSQL
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 5;

-- SQL Server
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Oracle
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
```

### 8. NULL Values? IS NULL vs IS NOT NULL? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Check for NULL values
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE phone IS NULL;

-- Check for non-NULL values
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;

-- NULL in calculations
SELECT name, salary, salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees;
-- If salary is NULL, annual_salary will be NULL
```

### 9. LIKE Operator & Wildcards? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- % matches any sequence of characters
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'John%';

-- _ matches single character
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'J_hn';

-- Case insensitive search
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%smith%';
```

### 10. IN vs EXISTS? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- IN operator
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE department_id IN (1, 2, 3);

-- EXISTS operator
SELECT * FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM departments d 
    WHERE d.id = e.department_id
);
```

---

## Joins & Relationships

### 11. Types of JOINs? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **INNER JOIN:** Returns matching records from both tables
- **LEFT JOIN:** All records from left table + matching from right
- **RIGHT JOIN:** All records from right table + matching from left
- **FULL OUTER JOIN:** All records from both tables

### 12. INNER JOIN Example? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- Only returns employees who have a department
```

### 13. LEFT JOIN vs RIGHT JOIN? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- LEFT JOIN - All employees, even without department
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- RIGHT JOIN - All departments, even without employees
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### 14. FULL OUTER JOIN? ‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- All employees and all departments
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### 15. Self JOIN? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Find employees and their managers
SELECT e1.name AS employee, e2.name AS manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```

### 16. Cross JOIN? ‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Cartesian product of two tables
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN departments d;
-- Returns every combination of employee and department
```

### 17. Multiple JOINs? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name, p.project_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
INNER JOIN employee_projects ep ON e.id = ep.employee_id
INNER JOIN projects p ON ep.project_id = p.id;
```

### 18. JOIN vs Subquery Performance? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- JOIN (usually faster)
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE d.location = 'New York';

-- Subquery
SELECT name FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York'
);
```

---

## Aggregate Functions & GROUP BY

### 19. Aggregate Functions? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
    COUNT(phone) AS employees_with_phone,
    SUM(salary) AS total_salary,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
    MIN(salary) AS min_salary,
    MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees;
```

### 20. GROUP BY Clause? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Group by single column
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Group by multiple columns
SELECT department_id, job_title, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id, job_title;
```

### 21. HAVING vs WHERE with GROUP BY? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'  -- Filter before grouping
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;     -- Filter after grouping
```

### 22. COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column)? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- COUNT(*) counts all rows including NULLs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

-- COUNT(column) counts non-NULL values only
SELECT COUNT(phone) FROM employees;

-- COUNT(DISTINCT column) counts unique non-NULL values
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) FROM employees;
```

### 23. Window Functions? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK
SELECT 
    name,
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_num,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;

-- Partition by department
SELECT 
    name,
    department_id,
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM employees;
```

### 24. LEAD and LAG Functions? ‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Compare with next/previous row
SELECT 
    name,
    salary,
    LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS prev_salary,
    LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS next_salary
FROM employees;
```

### 25. Running Totals? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Cumulative sum
SELECT 
    name,
    salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS running_total
FROM employees;
```

---

## Advanced Queries & Optimization

### 26. Subqueries Types? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Scalar subquery (returns single value)
SELECT name FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

-- Correlated subquery
SELECT name FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id
);

-- Table subquery
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
    FROM employees
) ranked_employees
WHERE rank <= 5;
```

### 27. Common Table Expressions (CTE)? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Simple CTE
WITH high_earners AS (
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 80000
)
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM high_earners
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Recursive CTE (Employee hierarchy)
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: Top-level managers
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 as level
    FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
```

### 28. UNION vs UNION ALL? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- UNION removes duplicates
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1
UNION
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000;

-- UNION ALL keeps duplicates (faster)
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000;
```

### 29. CASE Statement? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Simple CASE
SELECT 
    name,
    salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary > 80000 THEN 'High'
        WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS salary_category
FROM employees;

-- CASE in WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE 
    CASE 
        WHEN department_id = 1 THEN salary > 60000
        WHEN department_id = 2 THEN salary > 70000
        ELSE salary > 50000
    END;
```

### 30. Index Optimization? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_department ON employees(department_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_salary ON employees(salary);

-- Composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_salary ON employees(department_id, salary);

-- Query that uses index
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1;
-- Query that doesn't use index efficiently
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE UPPER(name) = 'JOHN';
```

### 31. Query Execution Plan? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- PostgreSQL
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

-- SQL Server
SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

-- MySQL
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

### 32. N+1 Query Problem? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Bad: N+1 queries (1 + N individual queries)
-- First query
SELECT id, name FROM employees;
-- Then for each employee (N queries)
SELECT department_name FROM departments WHERE id = ?;

-- Good: Single JOIN query
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### 33. Pagination Techniques? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- OFFSET/LIMIT (can be slow for large offsets)
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 100;

-- Cursor-based pagination (better performance)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE id > 100
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 20;
```

### 34. Database Transactions? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- ACID Properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

-- If both succeed
COMMIT;

-- If any fails
ROLLBACK;
```

### 35. Stored Procedures vs Functions? ‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Stored Procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDept(@dept_id INT)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = @dept_id;
END;

-- Function
CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeeCount(@dept_id INT)
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @count INT;
    SELECT @count = COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department_id = @dept_id;
    RETURN @count;
END;
```

## Database Design & Normalization

### 36. Database Normalization? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **1NF:** Atomic values, no repeating groups
- **2NF:** 1NF + no partial dependencies
- **3NF:** 2NF + no transitive dependencies
- **BCNF:** 3NF + every determinant is a candidate key

### 37. Normalization Example? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
-- Unnormalized table
CREATE TABLE orders_bad (
    order_id INT,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    customer_email VARCHAR(100),
    product_names VARCHAR(500),  -- Multiple products in one field
    product_prices VARCHAR(200)  -- Multiple prices in one field
);

-- Normalized tables
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);
```

### 38. Denormalization? When to Use? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Purpose:** Improve query performance
- **Trade-off:** Storage space vs query speed
- **Use cases:** Read-heavy applications, reporting systems
- **Example:** Storing calculated totals instead of computing

```sql
-- Denormalized for performance
CREATE TABLE order_summary (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),  -- Denormalized from customers table
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),  -- Calculated field stored
    item_count INT               -- Calculated field stored
);
```

### 39. Entity-Relationship (ER) Model? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Entity:** Real-world object (Customer, Order, Product)
- **Attribute:** Properties of entity (name, price, date)
- **Relationship:** Association between entities
- **Cardinality:** One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many

### 40. Database Constraints? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,                    -- Primary key constraint
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,           -- Not null constraint
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,            -- Unique constraint
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18),            -- Check constraint
    department_id INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 50000,   -- Default constraint
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)  -- Foreign key
);

-- Add constraint after table creation
ALTER TABLE employees 
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (salary > 0);
```

-- Index suggestions for above query
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON orders(order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_name ON customers(name);

-- Pagination with performance
-- BAD: OFFSET becomes slow with large offsets
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY id LIMIT 20 OFFSET 10000;

-- GOOD: Cursor-based pagination
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE id > 10000 
ORDER BY id
